## Basic Usage

Add the card to your Lovelace dashboard using YAML (for custom chip/entity names) or the UI (for default entity names). 

You can use music assistant actions in conjunction with "current" as the entity id and it will target whatever the current entity that is displayed in the card (e.g.: genres)

```yaml
type: custom:yet-another-media-player
entities:
  - media_player.downstairs_2
  - media_player.kitchen_speaker_2
  - media_player.kitchen_homepod
  - media_player.living_room_apple_tv
  - media_player.bedroom
  - media_player.entryway_speaker
actions:
  - name: Grunge
    service: music_assistant.play_media
    service_data:
      entity_id: current
      media_id: apple_music://playlist/pl.5feba9fd5ea441a29aeb3597c8314384
      enqueue: replace
  - name: Alternative
